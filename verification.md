# Plan 325 verification

## Evidence scope

- Branch: `plan-325`.
- Baseline commit: `b845880`.
- Verified state: the current uncommitted Plan 325 implementation.
- Runtime: MATLAB R2024b Update 4 with Optimization Toolbox.
- Date: 2026-08-20.
- Every maintained example used a finite jerk limit.

Each maintained example ran in its own MATLAB process. Runs were serial.
Headless controls disabled plots, animation, and pauses.

## Implemented contract changes

- Workspace bounds moved from planner options to
  `limits.azimuthInterval_deg` and `limits.elevationInterval_deg`.
- `MaximumPlanningTime_s` and the whole-planner deadline were removed.
- Required work uses deterministic seed, graph, iteration, evaluation,
  collocation, and refinement limits.
- Optional HS3 improvement retains its separate 15-second default limit.
- Stable verbose messages use the `[AzEl]` prefix and stage prefixes.
- Fixed-goal examples state earliest arrival. Moving-target examples state
  their target-time policy.
- The slalom elevation interval is `[-5 5]` degrees.
- All maintained examples route `MaxJerk_deg_s3` into physical limits.
- The plotter retains the `main` branch visual style.
- A planning-runtime non-regression gate now applies to later changes.

## Size checks

| Scope | Files | Physical lines | Limit | Result |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Core production, without plotting | 26 | 6,497 | 7,000 hard limit | pass |
| Plotting | 1 | 499 | separate report | pass |
| Production MATLAB | 27 | 7,000 | 7,000 hard limit | pass exactly |
| Complete MATLAB tree | 53 | 11,711 | 12,000 hard limit | pass by 289 |
| Complete MATLAB tree | 53 | 11,711 | 10,500 target | fail by 1,211 |

No production MATLAB file is longer than 900 lines. The preferred complete
tree target does not pass.

## Final headless example results

`P/V` means planner success and independent example-validation pass. `C/K`
means collision and kinematic certificate pass. `NaN` means unavailable after
an expected failure. Fixed target durations are required target times, not
minimum-time results.

The wide single-U request is unchanged. Its validated arrival duration is
26.493 seconds, which is below the requested 38-second threshold.

## Sparse visibility-graph experiment

The graph now tests deterministic Delaunay pairs plus all start and goal
connections. It does not change collision validation. The 40-circle case
tested 62 of 153 possible pairs and retained all 28 visible edges, the same
route, and the same arrival time. The wide U tested 55 of 120 possible pairs
and retained both homology classes and the same 26.493-second arrival. The
pair reduction is 59.5% and 54.2%, respectively. No wall-time gain was
confirmed, so this is a graph-work and memory improvement only.

## Runtime non-regression check

The shared-jerk correction preserves the old `[2 2]` defaults. Seven changed
examples stayed within 2.7% of their recorded runs. The basic example received
an explicit A/B check:

- old source: 18.842, 18.979, and 19.518 seconds;
- corrected source: 19.090, 19.239, and 19.279 seconds.

The ranges overlap. The 1.37% median difference is inside observed process
noise. The returned path and duration were identical. No confirmed runtime
increase was accepted.

## Display and verbose checks

- Visible success: obstacle-free planning passed and created three figures.
- Visible failure: the no-path example passed failure validation and created
  two diagnostic figures with reason `noValidatedSeed`.
- Verbose success: the obstacle-free example printed setup, seed generation,
  first motion, ten-iteration HS3 updates, selection, and completion lines.
- Quiet runs produced no planner progress text.

## Automated checks

- Full tests: 56 passed, 0 failed, and 0 incomplete.
- Full test process time: 35.3990197 seconds.
- Code Analyzer: 53 MATLAB files and 0 messages.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- MATLAB source lines longer than 100 characters: 0.
- Focused jerk-contract tests: 4 passed, 0 failed.

## Downloaded audit artifacts and cleanup decisions

The branch includes `repo_inconsistencies_plan_325.md` and
`repo_cleanup_audit_plan_325.md`. The workspace skill directory includes the
downloaded `repository-cleanup` skill.

The audits describe commit `b845880`, so some findings are stale after this
work. Workspace ownership, verbose behavior, timeout removal, production size,
and jerk routing are now corrected. `certifySeedCorridor` is retained because
the current production validator calls it. `RandomSeed` is retained for public
compatibility because removal would be a breaking result-schema change.
Polynomial-sampling and prepared-obstacle refactors remain measurement-first
cleanup candidates. They were not changed without profiler evidence.

## Known limits and claim

- Spatial and timed proposals use finite samples and can miss a feasible
  topology.
- Reduced seed geometry can reject a useful proposal. Final validation uses
  the original protected obstacle history.
- The analytic motion stops at geometric waypoints. HS3 is local and can
  return a poor local result.
- Solver matrix-conditioning warnings can occur. Accepted motions still pass
  independent validation.
- Periodic obstacle images are not implemented.
- Optimization Toolbox is required for HS3.

A successful result is an independently validated motion from a finite,
deterministic proposal set. The planner does not claim global route
completeness or global time optimality.
